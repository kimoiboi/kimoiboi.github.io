    <p class ="position"> I'm Karim Elgendi, a Senior Computer Science Student passionate about problem-solving, optimizing solutions, and innovative thinking with others. My expertise is with Java, C++, SQL, Linux and more. I've been actively involved with improving my skills by building personal projects, participating in Hackathons, & expanding my network. The challenges that come along with full-stack development during the building process and learning low-level embedded programming, where I can dive deeper about my interest with hardware performance and system design is exciting and fulfilling. Enjoy my creative showcase!</p>
