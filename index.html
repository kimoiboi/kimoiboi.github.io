        <h1><b>print('Hello World!')</b></h1>

        <p class="position">I'm Karim Elgendi, a Senior Computer Science student with a strong passion for problem-solving, optimizing solutions, and collaborating on innovative ideas. In my free time, I usually split my energy between the things I enjoy and the goals I’m working toward. I love playing video games on my computer with friends, heading to a gym lifting session, or driving out to play some pickup basketball whenever I can. Outside of school, I spend a lot of time with my family to keep myself grounded during the peak stressful times in a semester, especially during exam season. I’ve also got two amazing cats, Halo and Mochi—they both have completely opposite personalities making them like yin and yang, and they’ve made my role in the relationship as the...side-character! I’m also dedicating a big part of my free time to honing my skills through personal projects and constantly searching for opportunities to gain first-time experience. A mix of doing what I love and staying focused on where I would love to be makes up who I am as a person! My main technical expertise includes Java, C++, SQL, Linux, and several other tools that support modern development workflows. Over the past few years, I’ve been studying through college coursework, attending hackathons, and visiting professional networking opportunities. I find great excitement in the challenges that come with full-stack development—from managing both front-end and back-end systems—to exploring my recent interest in low-level embedded programming, where I can dive deeper into hardware performance and system design. The balance between creative thinking and deep technical work is what makes each project so rewarding to build. Currently, I’m working on two major projects. The first project is my personal portfolio website, where I’m combining design and functionality to highlight my growth as a developer. The second is a basic semester-long university project for a Software Engineering course—an Emergency Response CPR mobile app built using Dart and Flutter presenting it at the end of the semester. Both projects are actively documented on GitHub for transparency and collaboration. If you’d like to get in touch, please click the “Contact” button or simply scroll to the bottom of any page. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my creative showcase!</p>

        <h3><b>Becoming a 'Polished Programmer'</b></h3>
        <p class="position">I'm looking to get hands-on experience with hardware projects as I have piqued an interest with exploring different software and hardware technologies. As I expand my knowledge with C++, I'll be purchasing a microcontroller to dive deeper with embedded system development!</p>
