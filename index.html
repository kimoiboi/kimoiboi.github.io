        <p class="position">I'm Karim Elgendi, a Senior Computer Science Student passionate about problem-solving, optimizing solutions, and innovative thinking with others. My expertise is with Java, C++, SQL, Linux and more. I've been actively involved with improving my skills by building personal projects, participating in Hackathons, &amp; expanding my network. The challenges that come along with full-stack development during the building process and learning low-level embedded programming, where I can dive deeper about my interest with hardware performance and system design is an exciting and fulfilling journey. I am currently working on two different projects at the moment, the main project I am working on is this Porfolio Website. The other project I am working on is for a course in University related to Software Engineering, a Emergency Respone CPR app built around Dart and Flutter which are both documented on GitHub. To reach out to me please click the "Contact" button or scroll to the bottom of any page. Enjoy my creative showcase!</p>
