# The Beginning
Hello all, I'm happy to do this project that will serve as a resume/portfolio website... basic, I know. I have never learned and interacted with front-end coding elements like ***<ins>HTML, CSS, & JS</ins>*** since 
I am mainly using Java so I wanted to try out a ***<ins>project based learning experience</ins>***. I also did practice with Git, which makes me want to document the struggles of not having knowledge whatsoever, but 
this will help me get better at looking for answers and improving my problem-solving knowledge! <sub>lol..pls help me</sub>
